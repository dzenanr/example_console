DartExampleConsole
==================

In teaching programming a console with interactive communication between a user and a program is useful for learners and a teacher. For example, a teacher may give an exercise to do three programming tasks. Students write those programming tasks and prompt a teacher to execute them.  I have created a small Dart project in Dart Editor called ExampleConsole.
